abstract: Pathogen surveillance within wastewater rapidly progressed during the
SARS-CoV-2 pandemic and informed public health management. In addition to the
successful monitoring of entire sewer catchment basins at the treatment facility
scale, subcatchment or building-level monitoring enabled targeted support of
resource deployment. However, optimizing the temporal and spatial resolution of
these monitoring programs remains complex due to population dynamics and
within-sewer physical, chemical, and biological processes. To address these
limitations, this study explores the advancement of the building-scale network
that monitored the on-campus residential population at the University of
Colorado Boulder between August 2020 and May 2021 through a daily SARS-CoV-2
surveillance campaign. During the study period, SARS-CoV-2 infection prevalence
transitioned from robust community spread in Fall 2020 to sporadic infections in
Spring 2021. Temporally, these distinct phases enabled investigating the
effectiveness of resource commitment by exploring subsets of the original daily
sampling data. Spatially, select sampling sites were installed along the flow
path of the pipe network, enabling the exploration of the conservation of viral
concentrations within the wastewater. Infection prevalence and resource
commitment for informed action displayed an inverted relationship: higher
temporal and spatial resolution surveillance is more imperative during sporadic
infection phases than during high prevalence periods. This relationship was
reinforced when norovirus (two minor clusters) and influenza (primarily absent)
were additionally surveilled at a weekly frequency. Overall, resource commitment
should scale to meet the objectives of the monitoring campaignâ€”providing a
general prevalence estimate requires fewer resources than an early-warning and
targeted-action monitoring framework.
