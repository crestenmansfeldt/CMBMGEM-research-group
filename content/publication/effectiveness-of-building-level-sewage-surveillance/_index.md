abstract: To assist in the COVID-19 public health guidance on a college campus,
  daily composite wastewater samples were withdrawn at 20 manhole locations
  across the University of Colorado Boulder campus. Low-cost autosamplers were
  fabricated in-house to enable an economical approach to this distributed
  study. These sample stations operated from August 25th until November 23rd
  during the fall 2020 semester, with 1512 samples collected. The concentration
  of SARS-CoV-2 in each sample was quantified through two comparative reverse
  transcription quantitative polymerase chain reactions (RT-qPCRs). These
  methods were distinct in the utilization of technical replicates and
  normalization to an endogenous control. (1) Higher temporal resolution
  compensates for supply chain or other constraints that prevent technical or
  biological replicates. (2) The data normalized by an endogenous control agreed
  with the raw concentration data, minimizing the utility of normalization. The
  raw wastewater concentration values reflected SARS-CoV-2 prevalence on campus
  as detected by clinical services. Overall, combining the low-cost composite
  sampler with a method that quantifies the SARS-CoV-2 signal within six hours
  enabled actionable and time-responsive data delivered to key stakeholders.
  With daily reporting of the findings, wastewater surveillance assisted in
  decision making during critical phases of the pandemic on campus, from
  detecting individual cases within populations ranging from 109 to 2048
  individuals to monitoring the success of on-campus interventions.
