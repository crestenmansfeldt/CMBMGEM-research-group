abstract: Much of what is known and theorized concerning passive sampling
  techniques has been developed considering chemical analytes. Yet,
  historically, biological analytes, such as Salmonella typhi, have been
  collected from wastewater via passive sampling with Moore swabs. In response
  to the COVID-19 pandemic, passive sampling is re-emerging as a promising
  technique to monitor SARS-CoV-2 RNA in wastewater. Method comparisons and
  disease surveillance using composite, grab, and passive sampling for
  SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection have found passive sampling with a variety of
  materials routinely produced qualitative results superior to grab samples and
  useful for sub-sewershed surveillance of COVID-19. Among individual studies,
  SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentrations derived from passive samplers demonstrated
  heterogeneous correlation with concentrations from paired composite samples
  ranging from weak (R2 = 0.27, 0.31) to moderate (R2 = 0.59) to strong (R2 =
  0.76). Among passive sampler materials, electronegative membranes have shown
  great promise with linear uptake of SARS-CoV-2 RNA observed for exposure
  durations of 24 to 48 h and in several cases RNA positivity on par with
  composite samples. Continuing development of passive sampling methods for the
  surveillance of infectious diseases via diverse forms of fecal waste should
  focus on optimizing sampler materials for the efficient uptake and recovery of
  biological analytes, kit-free extraction, and resource-efficient testing
  methods capable of rapidly producing qualitative or quantitative data. With
  such refinements passive sampling could prove to be a fundamental tool for
  scaling wastewater surveillance of infectious disease, especially among the
  1.8 billion persons living in low-resource settings served by non-traditional
  wastewater collection infrastructure.
